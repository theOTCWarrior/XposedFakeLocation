**XposedFakeLocation** is an Android application and Xposed module that allows you to spoof your device's location globally or for specific apps without using "mock location" from the developer options. Customize your location with precision, including sensor data, and add randomization within a specified radius for enhanced privacy.

## **Features**

- **Global Location Spoofing**: Override your device's location data system-wide (Unstable for now).
- **Per-App Location Control**: Apply location spoofing to specific applications.
- **Custom Coordinates**: Set precise latitude and longitude.
- **Altitude and Accuracy Settings**: Customize altitude, accuracy and other custom sensor values.
- **Randomization**: Add random offsets within a specified radius for enhanced privacy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy configuration.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- **Rooted Android Device**: The app requires root access to function properly. That being said, you can try working with Xposed virtual environement on non rooted device.
- **LSPosed**: Install the Xposed Framework compatible with your Android version.
  - [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed)

---

## **Installation**

You can always install the latest stable version from the releases page. If you want to build by yourself:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noobexon1/XposedFakeLocation.git
   ```

2. **Build the Application**

   - Open the project in **Android Studio**.
   - Build the APK using **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**.
   - Alternatively, use Gradle:

     ```bash
     ./gradlew assembleDebug
     ```

3. **Install the APK on Your Device**

   - Transfer the APK to your device.
   - Install the APK using a file manager or via ADB:

     ```bash
     adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
     ```

4. **Activate the Xposed Module**

   - Open **Xposed Installer** or **LSPosed Manager**.
   - Enable the **XposedFakeLocation** module.
   - If you decide to apply the module system wide, Reboot your device to apply changes.

---

## **Usage**

1. **Launch the App**

   - Open **XposedFakeLocation** from your app drawer.

2. **Select a Location**

   - Use the integrated map to select your desired location.
   - Tap on the map to set the fake location.

3. **Configure Settings**

   - Access the **Settings** screen to customize:

     - **Accuracy**: Enable and set a custom horizontal and/or vertical accuracy value.
     - **Altitude**: Enable and set a custom altitude.
     - **Other Sensor Data**: New spoofable sensors data added in new versions.
     - **Randomization Radius**: Set the radius in meters for location randomization.

4. **Start Spoofing**

   - Toggle the **Start** button to begin location spoofing.
   - The app will now override your device's location data based on the target(s) specified in the Xpsoed manager app.

5. **Stop Spoofing**

   - Toggle the **Stop** button to cease location spoofing.

---

### **Favorites**

- Save frequently used locations for quick access.
- If a marker is already present on the map, the coordinates for the new favorite location will automatically be copied to the fields from it.
- Manage your favorites by adding or removing locations.

---

## **Development**

### **Built With**

- **Kotlin**: Programming language for Android development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
